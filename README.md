# Week 3 Homework Challenge -- Creating a random, customized password

## Description

The intention of this repo is to take an existing 'password generator' page and add the core functionality to actually make the password. A series of prompts will ask the user to define the character sets they want in the password; the password will then be automatically created based on the character sets chosen.
